          <p>
            Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. 
            These distant worlds come in many sizes and compositions, from rocky super-Earths to massive 
            gas giants, and they orbit their host stars at various distances.

              <p>
                We observe the slight dimming of a star's light when a planet passes in front of it. 
                This method was used by the Kepler Space Telescope to discover thousands of exoplanets.

              <h3>Radial Velocity</h3>
              <p>
                We detect the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. 
                This method can determine a planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

              <h3>Direct Imaging</h3>
              <p>
                We directly photograph exoplanets by blocking out the light from their host star. 
                This method works best for large planets far from their stars.

                We use the gravitational field of a planet and its star as a lens to magnify 
                light from a more distant star, revealing the planet's presence.

            The Kepler Space Telescope revolutionized exoplanet science by continuously monitoring 
            over 150,000 stars for nearly a decade. Using the transit method, Kepler discovered 
            more than 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and identified thousands more candidates.

          <h2>Our Role in Exoplanet Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            This project uses machine learning to analyze Kepler data and help distinguish between 
            real exoplanet signals and false positives. By training AI models on thousands of 
            known examples, we can automate the detection process and help astronomers focus on 
            the most promising candidates for further study.

            <h3>Machine Learning + Astronomy = Discovery</h3>
            <p>
              Our AI models achieve over 91% accuracy in classifying exoplanet candidates, 
              helping to accelerate the pace of discovery and reduce manual review time.
